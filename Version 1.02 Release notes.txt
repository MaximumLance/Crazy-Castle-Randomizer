Version 1.02 addresses some bugs with the randomizer.

- When using a password to continue where you left off, unexpected or corrupt stages could be loaded instead of what was intended.

An oversight in the way the game handled getting you back in the list of randomized stages was corrected.

- Players don't lose lives from dying.

This is because I wanted to have players not lose a life when going to a special stage and have them lose the life inside the special stage instead if they failed. Instead it only decreased a life if you died within the special stage.

As such, you will lose a life when going to a special stage like the original version, but not if you die within the special stage.

- When hitting no on the continue screen, you are brought to Level 1 instead of the first randomized level.

Code has been added to handle this properly now.
