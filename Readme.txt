Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle Randomizer
Version 1.00
Released 10/23/21

Instructions:

1. Use the patch file to patch a known good dump of Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle. If you want to be sure the file is good, make sure it matches this hash:

SHA-1: 3769F52F919019098C4DD3CE81E029A015E720DD

2. Open the Simple Randomizer Maker. Click load file and open the ROM file you just patched. Choose the settings you want to randomize and then click Randomize!

The program will take a few seconds to randomize the ROM file. If it appears unresponsive, just wait. It will time out after 20 seconds if it fails to make the seed.

If the seed ROM is made, it will create a directory called Output in this folder. You will find the randomized ROM in there.

3. Run the Randomizer Logic. It will ask for the Randomized ROM you created. Load the file into it and it will program the game to accept the randomized values generated by the Simple Randomizer Maker.

Your ROM is now ready to be played.
